Code for the talk "Dev Containers for R"

## Step 1

Try the Dev Container in GitHub Codespaces! If you have access to GitHub CodeSpaces, click the green "Code <>" button at the top right, and then select "Create codespace on main".

Once the Dev Container has started, browse to the file [intro-regression-R-tidymodels/solution/Challenge-regression.ipynb](intro-regression-R-tidymodels/solution/Challenge-regression.ipynb). This will launch a Jupyter Notebook.

## Step 2

Run the Dev Container on your local machine.
