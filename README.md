## Dev Containers in GitHub Codepaces

If you have access to GitHub CodeSpaces, click the green "Code <>" button at the top right on this repository page, and then select "Create codespace on main". (GitHub CodeSpaces is available with [GitHub Enterprise](https://github.com/enterprise) and [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/).)

Once the Dev Container has started, browse to the file [intro-regression-R-tidymodels/solution/Challenge-regression.ipynb](intro-regression-R-tidymodels/solution/Challenge-regression.ipynb). This will launch a Jupyter Notebook.
